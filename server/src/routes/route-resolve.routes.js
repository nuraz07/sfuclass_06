/**
 * route-resolve.routes — GET /rooms/:id/node. [UNCHANGED — reference fassung]
 *
 * The smallest route in the system and the one that decides whether a lesson works.
 *
 * mediasoup is not stateless: a room's transports, producers and consumers live in the
 * memory of one SFU process. Every participant in a room must therefore land on the *same*
 * node, and the ALB cannot do that — it balances connections, not rooms. So the client asks
 * here first, gets a node, and connects to that node's WSS endpoint directly.
 *
 * The mapping lives in Redis (RoomRegistry), because the answer must be identical across
 * every API task and must survive an API task being replaced mid-lesson.
 *
 * Assignment happens once, on the first request for a room, and is sticky until the room
 * ends. A drained node is never assigned a new room, which is what makes a rolling SFU
 * deploy invisible to lessons that have not started yet.
