-- Atomic seat reservation  (F1)  [UNCHANGED]
--
-- Reference implementation; keep yours if it differs.
--
-- Runs inside Redis so that checking the limit and taking the seat are one
-- operation. Done from the application they are two, and two API tasks admitting
-- the last learner at the same moment both see "one seat left" and both let them
-- in — which is how a plan with a 25-seat limit ends up with 27 people in a room.
--
-- Seats are a hash of userId -> expiry rather than a counter. A counter cannot
-- tell a rejoin from a new arrival, and a dropped connection that never released
-- its seat would leak one permanently. Every call prunes what has expired, so a
-- browser that crashed frees its seat within the TTL without anyone acting.
--
-- KEYS[1]  the room's seat hash
-- ARGV[1]  userId
-- ARGV[2]  limit            seats the plan allows
-- ARGV[3]  now              milliseconds
-- ARGV[4]  ttl              milliseconds a seat survives without a heartbeat
--
-- Returns: { granted, occupied, remaining, rejoined }

-- `or 0` because a missing limit must not become nil: Lua will not compare nil
-- with a number, and line 58 then fails the reservation for a room that is
-- empty. 0 is also what plans.max_seats uses for "unlimited", so the two
-- meanings coincide rather than conflict.
