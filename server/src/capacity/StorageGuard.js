/**
 * Storage quota  (F4, F6)  [NEW]
 *
 * The gate in front of every presign. `UploadService.createUpload` calls
 * `assertStorageAvailable` before it creates anything, and that call is the only
 * thing standing between a tenant and a bill for storage they never bought.
 *
 * Storage differs from seats in the way that matters here: a seat is freed when
 * a lesson ends, but storage only comes back when somebody deletes something.
 * So the failure mode is not a race at the door, it is a slow drift where the
 * recorded usage and the real usage disagree until the quota stops meaning
 * anything.
 *
 * Two mechanisms deal with that:
 *
 *   reservations   a presign holds the bytes it is about to use, in Redis, with
 *                  a TTL matching the upload window. Without this, ten
 *                  simultaneous 5 GB presigns each see the same free space and
 *                  all ten pass.
 *
 *   reconciliation a nightly recount from the database, because reservations
 *                  expire, uploads fail halfway, and the cached number is an
 *                  optimisation rather than the truth.
