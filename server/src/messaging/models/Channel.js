/**
 * Channel  (F6)
 *
 * The public side of messaging. Three scopes, one table:
 *
 *   public   the tenant-wide lobby. Exactly one per tenant, created on setup.
 *   space    bound to a community space, auto-provisioned with it
 *   course   bound to a course, auto-provisioned on publish
 *
 * The difference from a Conversation is who can read it. A conversation has a
 * participant set; a channel has a scope, and everyone inside that scope can
 * read it — including history from before they joined. That last part is the
 * point of a channel: a learner who enrols in week six can read weeks one to
 * five.
 *
 * Membership rows exist, but they carry preferences (mute, last read), not
 * permission. Deleting one does not remove access.
