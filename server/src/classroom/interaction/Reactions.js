/**
 * Reactions  (F1)  [NEW]
 *
 * Ephemeral emoji. Nothing is persisted, nothing is stored, and that is the
 * design rather than an omission.
 *
 * A reaction is a way of saying "yes" without unmuting. It is meaningful for
 * about three seconds and meaningless afterwards, so putting it in the chat
 * history would be adding noise to something people read later. Compare
 * LiveChat.js, which is the opposite decision for the opposite reason.
 *
 * The rate limit exists because a burst of emoji from thirty people is the
 * cheapest way to make a lesson unreadable, and because a script can send
 * hundreds a second.
