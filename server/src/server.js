/**
 * API entrypoint  (F7)  [EXT]
 *
 * Boot order, and every step depends on the one before it:
 *
 *   1. secrets into process.env      before anything reads configuration
 *   2. import config/env.js          validates and exits on a bad environment
 *   3. tracing                       before the modules it instruments load
 *   4. connect Postgres and Redis    fail fast rather than on first request
 *   5. HTTP server + socket gateways
 *   6. mark ready                    only now does /readyz answer 200 and the
 *                                    load balancer start sending traffic
 *   7. register shutdown handlers
 *
 * Steps 1–3 are why the imports below are dynamic. A static import graph would
 * evaluate config/env.js before hydrateSecrets() had run, and validation would
 * fail on secrets that were about to arrive.
 *
 * Shutdown is the mirror image, and is what makes a rolling deploy invisible:
 * stop accepting connections, let in-flight work finish, close the pools, exit.
 * ECS sends SIGTERM and waits; if this process ignores it, users see dropped
 * requests on every deployment.
