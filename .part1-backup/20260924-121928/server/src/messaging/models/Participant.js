/**
 * Participant  (F6)
 *
 * Membership of a conversation, and the per-person preferences that go with it:
 * muted, and where they have read up to.
 *
 * `last_read_at` is a timestamp rather than a message id, which is worth
 * defending: an id would be precise but breaks when that message is deleted,
 * and a timestamp answers the only question anyone asks — "how many arrived
 * after this" — with a range scan on the index that already exists.
 *
 * Leaving sets `left_at` rather than deleting the row. Otherwise a person's own
 * messages lose their membership context, and rejoining a group would show them
 * as having read everything they missed.
