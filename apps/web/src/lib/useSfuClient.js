/**
 * Builds the SfuClient for one lesson  (F1)
 *
 * Lives in apps/web rather than in CoreProvider on purpose. A tab has one HTTP
 * client and one chat socket for its whole life; a lesson does not. Keeping the
 * media stack here means `mediasoup-client` is imported only from the lazy
 * classroom route, so somebody who never opens a lesson never downloads it —
 * which is the entire reason vite.config.ts gives `rtc` its own chunk.
 *
 * Everything this assembles already exists in @classroom/core-client. The three
 * browser implementations below are selected, not written:
 *
 *   createBrowserDeviceAdapter       camera, microphone, device enumeration
 *   createBrowserScreenShareAdapter  getDisplayMedia, including the browser's
 *                                    own stop bar
 *   createSocketClient               already implements SignalingTransport
 *
 * SfuClient takes a transport *factory*, not a transport: a rejoin after a node
 * drains throws the old socket away and builds a fresh one, and a factory is
 * what lets it do that without reaching back into this file.
